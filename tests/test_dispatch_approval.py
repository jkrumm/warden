"""Regression suite for the signed-approval gate on `hermes-cc.sh`'s write verbs.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SAME AS `--confirm`.

`--confirm` is a flag the calling agent sets on its own invocation, so it constrains
only an agent that chooses to be constrained. The gate tested here does not: an
approval is a Slack button click, witnessed by the gateway process and signed there
with an Ed25519 key whose private half never leaves that process's memory. Every row
in `dispatch_approvals` is writable by this uid — the agent's uid — so the suite's
central case is the FORGED one: a row with `decision='approve'` and a plausible
signature, written exactly as a compromised agent would write it, must still refuse.

The cases:

  - the two hash implementations (shell and plugin) agree, so the gate can match at all
  - planning mints a pending row; a rehearsal (`--dry-run`) mints nothing
  - `--confirm` with no approval refuses (exit 4) and says how to get one
  - `--confirm` with an unsigned approve row refuses            <- the forgery case
  - `--confirm` with a row signed by the WRONG key refuses      <- the forgery case
  - `--confirm` with a valid signature passes the gate, and the audit line names
    the approver — the only field an agent could not have written for itself
  - a denial refuses, and is distinguishable from an absence
  - an expired approval refuses
  - an approval is single-use: the second `--confirm` refuses
  - editing the brief after approval refuses (the hash binds the payload)
  - editing --why after approval refuses (the button showed that reason)
  - swapping the --context-file after approval refuses (the plan never shows it, and
    the click replays unattended — it must be in the hash)
  - an Approve click replays the stored brief + context bytes with the agent's
    --brief-file/--context-file temp files already deleted
  - a budget refusal leaves the approval unspent (budget is checked before the gate)
  - a missing public key refuses rather than falling back to instruction-level
  - only the gateway publishes a signing key, and a clobbered one is republished
    before signing (the 2026-08-03 outage, as a test)
  - the plugin has NO write path of its own left: with warden's intent queue stubbed
    out, a click cannot decide a row
  - the whole chain against the REAL warden/scripts/intents.py — spool, drain, and a
    row carrying a signature that verifies, with payload_hash/expires_at/spent_at
    untouched
  - an already-decided row short-circuits before signing and before spawning anything
  - a drain that exits non-zero over somebody ELSE'S rejected file still succeeds,
    because the row is the source of truth
  - the intent the plugin builds passes warden's own `intents.validate()` — the
    contract test between the two repos
  - `_load_invocation` cannot write

Run:

    warden/.venv/bin/python3 tests/test_dispatch_approval.py  (or: make test, from warden/)

Exit status is 0 only when every case matches. Nothing here touches the real
dispatch DB, the real audit log, Slack, or the network.
