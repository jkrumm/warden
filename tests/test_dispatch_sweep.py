"""Regression suite for `format_message()` in scripts/dispatch-sweep.py's
merged-dispatch rendering.

WHY THIS GUARD EXISTS. `scripts/hermes-cc.sh`'s `merge <job-id>` verb
deliberately does NOT stamp `reported_at` on the dispatch row — the merge
announcement and the sweeper's own verdict message are considered two
different things, sent at two different times. That is correct, but it
means the sweeper still owes a verdict for a dispatch that has already been
merged, and until this fix it rendered that verdict exactly as it would for
an untouched draft PR.

Observed live 2026-08-02, job `6f7c9cc4-641d-4088-9a94-65845a1b1f4b`:

    merged_at   = 2026-08-02T19:06:00.574298+00:00
    reported_at = 2026-08-02T19:10:02.336915+00:00

Hermes announced the merge in Slack, and four minutes later the sweeper
posted "here is your draft PR, review it" for a PR that was already merged
and closed. The `dispatches` table already carried a `merged_at TEXT`
column; `format_message()` simply never read it.

The fix threads `merged_at` from the row into `format_message()` and makes
a merged dispatch render honestly: the header gets a merged marker, the
artifact line states the merge instead of implying review is pending, and
the footer's `next` field stops repeating the episode's stale `nextAction`
("review the draft PR") in favour of `none (merged)`. A malformed or
missing `merged_at` value must fail *toward* still calling it merged — the
merge happened; only the display of when degrades — because the entire
point of this guard is to stop a stale review instruction from reaching a
human, and silently falling back to the old wording would reintroduce
exactly that bug.
