# hermes-cc — the ONLY way the Hermes agent opens a Claude Code episode.
#
# HOME: this file since 2026-09-10. hermes-agent/scripts/hermes-cc.sh (which is
# also ~/.hermes/scripts/hermes-cc.sh) is now an exec shim into this one — the
# Hermes-side guards key on that path, so callers keep using it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Hermes observes well and reads repos badly: gpt-5.6-luna
# with a `terminal` tool cannot use a repo's CLAUDE.md, .claude/rules/ or
# .claude/skills/, and that context is exactly what triage needs. So Hermes hands
# the episode to Claude Code instead — but "hand work to a coding agent" composed
# as free-form shell by an LLM is the single worst shape this machine could grow.
# A closed verb set breaks the trade the same way hermes-ops.sh does for infra:
# `hermes-cc.sh dispatch sideclaw` is a benign script call whether or not the LLM
# understood what it was doing.
#
# The design rule to defend in review: NO VERB ACCEPTS A FILESYSTEM PATH, A
# COMMAND, OR A URL. A dispatch names a REPO — a bare name, resolved by this
# script under the single root in config/dispatch-repos.json, which also carries
# the denials and the per-repo tier ceilings. One free-form escape hatch and the
# whole exercise is theatre.
#
# THE BRIEF IS DATA, NEVER COMMAND. It arrives on stdin or via --brief-file, and
# is never taken as an argv string. That is not fussiness: the brief is assembled
# by an LLM out of Slack messages, GitHub issue bodies and log lines, i.e. from
# material an attacker can write. As an argv element it would be composed into a
# shell line and expanded by the shell BEFORE this script ever ran, so `$(...)`
# inside a Slack message would execute. On stdin there is no expansion step. The
# skill instructs Hermes to use a QUOTED heredoc (`<<'BRIEF'`) for the same reason
# one level up.
#
# TIERS — the episode's permission profile, capped per-repo by the dispatch policy.
#   investigate  read-only session, verdict only. Cannot lose anything, so it
#                needs no approval theatre and is safe to permit outright.
#   author       read-only session + a filed GitHub issue. Ungated: an issue is
#                a note on a list, and a wrong one is closed in two seconds.
#   implement    write session in an isolated worktree, branch + DRAFT PR.
#                Requires --why AND --confirm. Never merges, never pushes to a
#                default branch, in ANY repo — including the direct-to-master
#                ones. That deviation from the repo's own convention is the
#                point: the convention was written by a human for their own
#                commits, not for an unattended episode.
# A tier a repo does not allow is REFUSED, never quietly downgraded to a weaker
# run whose caller then believes a PR exists.
#
# THE --confirm GATE IS NOT A FORMALITY. Without it, `implement` prints exactly
# what it would do and exits 0 having changed nothing. --confirm means Johannes
# confirmed, which in Slack means Hermes had to ask him first and he answered.
# An agent that passes --confirm because it "seems fine" has removed the only
# human in the loop; the skill says so in those words.
#
# --AUTO-FROM-ITEM IS A SECOND, NARROWER DOOR, NOT A REPLACEMENT. --confirm stays
# the gate for Hermes's conversational path — a signed Slack click. The alert
# triage loop (warden's scripts/triage.py) has no Slack round-trip to click one into, so
# `dispatch <repo> --tier implement --auto-from-item <event_id>` lets it in a
# different way: every precondition (a `verdict`-state triage_items row for that
# event, its linked investigate dispatch done with nextAction=implement AND
# confidence=high, the repo matching what that verdict was actually about, the
# repo's own policy ceiling, the implement budget) is RE-CHECKED against
# ~/.warden/warden.db at call time, never trusted from the caller's argv. BE HONEST ABOUT
# WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not a signature the way --confirm's approval artifact
# is — nothing here is cryptographically bound the way a Slack click is. It is a
# precondition the caller cannot fabricate CHEAPLY: every fact it checks is a row
# a real, already-completed read-only episode wrote earlier, not an argument
# supplied now. The threat it closes is the loop being WRONG (a stale item, a
# low-confidence verdict, a repo mismatch) — not the loop being HOSTILE. A wholly
# compromised triage.py (or anything else on this uid) is the same threat model
# --confirm's own paragraph above already disclaims for a compromised Hermes.
#
# NO RECURSION. A dispatched episode may never dispatch. Enforced structurally,
# not by instruction: this script refuses to run inside a Claude Code session, and
# the brief handed to an episode never carries a credential that would let it call
# back in.
#
# Secrets resolve through `secrets-run`, the op shim (age-encrypted offline cache
# on this headless mini; live biometric op on the MacBook). A bare `op` here hangs
# on a prompt nobody can answer, which is why the backend marker is a hard gate.
# Today only the recursion guard and the budget need no secret — sideclaw is
# localhost and unauthenticated — but the gate stays so a future authenticated
# endpoint cannot be added without noticing.
#
# AUDIT LOG: ~/Library/Logs/hermes-cc.log, one line per invocation, always —
# including usage errors, refusals and budget denials. Register it with the
# existing com.jkrumm.log-rotate LaunchAgent by adding `hermes-cc.log` to the
# FILES array in dotfiles/scripts/log-rotate.sh (that list is DECLARED, never
# globbed, so an unregistered log is an unbounded log).
#
# TESTS: warden/tests/test_hermes_cc.py (run with warden's own venv:
# `warden/.venv/bin/python3 warden/tests/test_hermes_cc.py`, or `make test` from
# warden/) covers the
# properties above — the closed verb set, argument bounding, the repo policy,
# tier gating, the brief-never-from-argv rule, the recursion guard, the daily
# budget, the --json contract and the audit log — against a stubbed job server,
# never a real one. Re-run it after any edit here.

BUILT_TIERS=(investigate author implement)
# Tiers that need Johannes to have said yes before they run. The criterion is the
# COST OF BEING WRONG, not "does it mutate anything outside this machine" — `author`
# mutates external state too (it files an issue) and is deliberately ungated, because
# a wrong issue is closed in two seconds and leaves nothing behind. A wrong branch and
# draft PR costs a real review. Kept as its own list rather than hardcoded at the call

#
# NOTE ON WHAT THIS GATE IS. `--confirm` is a flag on the same invocation, supplied by
# the same agent it constrains — so it is an INSTRUCTION-LEVEL gate, not a cryptographic
# one, and a Hermes that decided to lie could pass it. That is accepted: the threat model
# here is prompt injection reaching a brief, and the brief cannot reach argv (see the
# header). Defending against a wholly-compromised Hermes would need an approval artifact
# minted outside the agent and bound to the repo + brief hash, which is a different design.
# What this gate does buy is that the DEFAULT path stops and asks, and that every skip
# leaves a `mode=planned` / `mode=opened` pair in the audit log to be read after the fact.

# INDEX, and every column added after a table first shipped) is owned and

# writes rows into dispatches and dispatch_approvals, never their shape. db_py()
# asserts WARDEN_SCHEMA_VERSION below instead of creating or altering anything;
# see ledger.py's own schema block for the tables' current definitions.
#
# Columns added after each table first shipped, kept here as a reader's map for
# the queries below (ledger.py, not this comment, is the source of truth):
#   dispatch_approvals.argv_json  the exact argv the plan was minted for, minus
#                                 --confirm — what the Approve click re-runs.
#   dispatch_approvals.stdin_text the brief (dispatch) or NULL (merge). Stored
#                                 because the brief is stdin data, never argv.
#   dispatch_approvals.context_text the --context-file bytes, or NULL. Stored so
#                                 the click replays what was hashed, not whatever
#                                 the path holds by then (the file is usually gone).
#   dispatches.poll_misses        consecutive sideclaw 404s the sweeper has
#                                 seen for this job; 3 -> status `lost`.
#   dispatches.validation_job_id  the job id of triage.py's own step-7 review
#                                 episode of THIS (implement) dispatch's diff.
#   dispatches.validation_status  NULL | 'confirmed' | 'disagreed' | 'error',
#                                 written by triage.py once that review lands.
#                                 cmd_merge's gate refuses anything but the

#
# It does NOT defend against a wholly-compromised Hermes with a debugger on the gateway.
# That was never the claim, and the script's header says so about `--confirm` too.
#
# FAILS CLOSED, EVERYWHERE. No public key, no plugin, no gateway, an expired row, a

# =============================================================================
# MERGE
# =============================================================================
#
# The only verb that changes what RUNS. Everything else in this script produces a
# proposal — an issue, a branch, a draft PR — that a human reads before it means
# anything. This one lands a commit on a default branch with no human in the loop,
# by owner decision (2026-08-02), and it inverts a design statement sideclaw's
# `openPullRequest` makes in a comment: "un-drafting is not something the episode
# can do for itself". It is now something a bounded verb can do for it. So the
# bounds have to carry the weight the human used to:
#
#   - It merges only a PR THIS BRIDGE OPENED. The argument is a job id, not a PR
#     number and not a URL: the PR is looked up from the dispatch row, so there is
#     no shape of caller input that names an arbitrary pull request. That is the
#     same property the repo argument has, for the same reason.
#   - It never merges where a human review is required. Eligibility is derived
#     from `pr-required-repos.json`, the file the branch-protection hook and
#     `github-config.sh` already share — not from a list kept here that would
#     drift out of agreement with them.
#   - Every bound the episode was held to is re-checked against the CURRENT head:
#     the base is the default branch, the head is a `dispatch/…` branch in this
#     same repo (never a fork), no `.github/workflows|actions` path is touched,
#     the size ceilings still hold. The merge itself pins that head SHA, so a push
#     landing between inspection and merge fails the merge rather than riding it.
#   - `mergeable_state` must be exactly `clean`. `blocked` (a required review or
#     check is missing) and `unstable` (something is failing) are refusals, not
#     judgement calls.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do: merge anything it did not open, force-push,
# retarget a base, override a protection rule, or merge a PR a human has pushed
# to. On each of those it stops and says which one.

# Terminal-ish states this verb refuses to look at. Kept as data so the refusal
# can name the actual state rather than "not mergeable".

# --- the merge gate: declared path scope, CI reality, step-7 validation ------
#
# Re-keyed off measured findings, not a redesign for its own sake. The OLD
# primary key was MAX_MERGE_FILES/MAX_MERGE_LINES (40 files / 2000 lines) —
# nothing like the narrow class this verb was meant for, and its CI check was
# `mergeable_state == "clean"`, which GitHub reports as clean whenever a repo
# has ZERO required PR-time checks — true for `vps` (no .github/workflows at
# all) and `research-gateway`, so that condition was passing with nothing
# having run. The size ceilings stay, but only as a BACKSTOP now (checked
# earlier in cmd_merge, unchanged) — a one-line `restart: no` in a production
# compose file passes any line count and must still be refused by path scope.
#
# The new primary key is $TRIAGE_POLICY_JSON's (warden/config/triage-policy.json)
# `repos.<repo>` entry:
#   autoMergePaths  a glob list. EVERY changed path must match one, or refuse —
#                   no repo gets an implicit allow by omission.
#   noCiRequired    an explicit per-repo acknowledgement that this repo has no
#                   PR-time checks, so their absence is a known condition
#                   rather than a silently-passed test. A repo with zero
#                   check-runs on the head commit and NO noCiRequired entry
#                   FAILS this gate — that inversion is the point.
# Plus, unconditionally: the step-7 validation (a DIFFERENT model reviewing
# the actual diff — see triage.py) must have written 'confirmed', never a
# missing, disagreeing, or errored review read as a pass.

hermes-cc — hand a bounded Claude Code episode to one repo, and track it.

  hermes-cc.sh <verb> [args] [--tier T] [--wait] [--json] [--dry-run]
                            [--why "reason"] [--confirm]
                            [--brief-file P] [--context-file P]
                            [--origin-channel C…] [--origin-thread TS]
                            [--origin-event N] [--auto-from-item N] [--model ID]

VERBS
  dispatch <repo>      Open an episode inside <repo>. Brief on stdin (quoted
                       heredoc) or --brief-file. --wait polls in-turn.
                       --auto-from-item <event_id> is a second, narrower door
                       into `implement`, for warden's scripts/triage.py only —
                       every precondition (a `verdict`-state triage item for
                       that event, its investigate dispatch done with
                       nextAction=implement + confidence=high, the repo
                       matching, budget) is re-checked from ~/.warden/warden.db
                       at call time; no --confirm needed once it passes. --model
                       overrides the worker model for this one job (sideclaw
                       validates/routes it) — used by triage.py's step-7
                       validation episode, deliberately a different model.
  status <job-id>      Poll one episode; folds a terminal outcome into its record.
                       After sideclaw prunes the job (24 h) it answers from the
                       record's own verdict instead.
  list [open|today|all]  List dispatch records. Default: open.
  merge <job-id>       Land the draft PR an `implement` episode opened: mark it
                       ready for review, merge it, delete the branch. Needs
                       --why AND --confirm; without --confirm it prints the plan
                       and changes nothing. Takes a JOB ID, never a PR number —
                       it merges only what this bridge opened.
  cancel <job-id>      Abandon the LOCAL record. Needs --why and --confirm.

TIERS
  investigate  read-only session, verdict only. Default. Ungated.
  author       read-only session + one filed GitHub issue. Ungated.
  implement    write session in an ISOLATED worktree, branch + DRAFT PR.
               Requires --why AND --confirm. Without --confirm it prints the
               plan and exits 0 having done nothing. It never merges and never
               pushes to a default branch, in ANY repo — including the
               direct-to-master ones, deliberately.
  A repo's ceiling lives in config/dispatch-repos.json and wins over the request.

BUDGETS   20 dispatches per UTC day overall, and 5 of those may be `implement`
          (HERMES_CC_DAILY_BUDGET / HERMES_CC_IMPLEMENT_BUDGET). Counted from
          the dispatches table, not a counter file. Every dispatch, plan,
          status and list reports the standing counts as `budget`, and adds a
          `budget.warning` naming the env var once a ceiling is close — so the
          bound is visible on the way up, not only when it refuses. A refusal is
          exit 4 and never a downgrade: raise the ceiling deliberately or wait
          for 00:00 UTC, do not retry into it. `merge` has a third, tighter
          ceiling of 3/day (HERMES_CC_MERGE_BUDGET) — it is the only verb that
          changes what runs.

MERGE     `merge <job-id>` lands the draft PR an `implement` episode opened, with
          no human on GitHub. It merges ONLY a PR recorded in the dispatches
          table (a job id in, never a PR number), only where a human review is
          not required — eligibility is derived from pr-required-repos.json, the
          same file the branch-protection hook reads — and only when every bound
          the episode was held to still holds against the CURRENT head: base is
          the default branch, head is a dispatch/… branch in this repo (never a
          fork), no .github/workflows change, size ceilings intact (a BACKSTOP,
          not primary — see below), no merge conflict. The PRIMARY gate is
          ~/SourceRoot/warden/config/triage-policy.json's `repos.<repo>` entry:
          EVERY changed path must match `autoMergePaths`, and the head commit's
          CI check-runs must either all pass or the repo must explicitly
          declare `noCiRequired` —
          a repo with zero checks and no such entry FAILS this gate rather than
          reading `mergeable_state: clean` (vacuously true with nothing run) as
          a pass. The step-7 validation (dispatches.validation_status) must
          also read exactly `confirmed`. The head SHA is pinned in the merge
          call, so a push landing mid-inspection fails the merge instead of
          riding it. On success, a repo whose policy entry sets
          `"autoDeploy": true` (default false — ships disabled) runs its
          declared `deploy` key (same closed-allowlist shape) if every merged
          path is inside `autoMergePaths`; the outcome rides in the merge
          response's `deploy` field.

THE BRIEF IS DATA, NEVER COMMAND
  It is read from stdin or a file — never taken as an argv string. Use a QUOTED
  heredoc so the shell does not expand what a Slack message wrote:

      hermes-cc.sh dispatch sideclaw --wait --json <<'BRIEF'
      The check job for repo X has failed three times since 14:00. Why?
      BRIEF

DELIBERATELY NOT IMPLEMENTED
  free-form path / command / URL   The escape hatch that would defeat the point.
  restart / redeploy / any infra   hermes-ops.sh owns mutation, with its own
                                   verb set and tiering. A dispatch that wants to
                                   restart a container is a routing bug.
  mid-run steering                 An episode has a verdict, not a conversation.
                                   `rd bg` + `rd say` already do that shape.
  killing a running episode        sideclaw has no cancel endpoint; `cancel`
                                   abandons the record and says so.
  dispatching from inside a session A dispatched episode may never dispatch.

--json      Exactly ONE JSON object on stdout per invocation, success or failure.
            A failure carries ok:false and exitCode in that same object; anything
            unstructured goes to stderr, so stdout always parses.

EXIT CODES  0 ok · 2 precondition failed · 3 remote failed · 4 policy/budget
            refusal (incl. a DENIED repo, a tier over its ceiling) · 64 usage
            error (a misspelled repo, a bad flag, an empty brief)
AUDIT LOG   ~/Library/Logs/hermes-cc.log (one line per invocation, always)
BUDGET      See BUDGETS above. Counted from the dispatches table, never a file.
