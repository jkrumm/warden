"""Validate config/dispatch-repos.json and summarise what it permits.

Moved here from hermes-agent with hermes-cc.sh and its policy file (2026-09-10).
This used to be a python one-liner inside a Makefile, which was tolerable when the file
was a flat repo -> maxTier map and is not now that it is a policy with four interacting
keys. The checks below are the same ones `hermes-cc.sh` makes at dispatch time, run at
setup time instead: `hermes-cc.sh` fails CLOSED on a malformed policy, which is correct
but surfaces the problem mid-incident on the first dispatch. Catch it while nobody is
waiting on an answer. Distinct from check-dispatch-policy.py, which compares this file
against sideclaw's copy rather than validating its own shape.

Exits 0 with a one-line summary, or non-zero with the reason.
