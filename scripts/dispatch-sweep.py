"""Dispatch sweep — the return path that closes a dispatch without a human.

Runs every 5 min as a Hermes `no_agent` cron script, invoked as `python3
<path>` with no args. Under `no_agent`, the script's stdout would normally
BE the delivered message (see cron/scheduler.py) — but this script already
does its own per-dispatch delivery via `hermes send` into each dispatch's own
origin thread, which is a different target per row, not the cron's single
configured target. So production stdout is always empty; every diagnostic
goes to stderr, and empty stdout on the cron path just means "no framework
double-delivery," not "nothing happened."

WHAT IT DOES, one pass: read every dispatch row with `reported_at IS NULL`
(watchdog.db's `dispatches` table, owned by scripts/hermes-cc.sh — see
docs/dispatch-bridge.md § "The dispatch record"). For each, poll sideclaw's
job endpoint. A still-running job is left alone. A terminal job (done,
failed, interrupted) gets folded back into the row (status, verdict_json,
finished_at), then — if the dispatch has an origin_channel — a deterministic,
no-LLM message is composed and sent via `hermes send`, and only a delivery
exit code 0 stamps `reported_at`. A dispatch with no origin_channel (e.g.
opened from a context with no Slack thread to answer into) can never be
delivered anywhere, so it is closed with a sentinel instead of accumulating
as a permanent debt — see UNDELIVERABLE_SENTINEL below.

CRASH SAFETY — read this before changing the write order. The script must be
killable at any instant without losing a debt:
  1. The terminal-status UPDATE (status/verdict_json/finished_at) commits
     BEFORE any delivery attempt. A kill here just means the next sweep
     re-polls a job that's already terminal and re-derives the same update —
     idempotent, no harm.
  2. `reported_at` is stamped ONLY after `hermes send` returns exit code 0,
     in its own commit, immediately. A kill between the send and this commit
     means the next sweep sends the same message again (the row is still
     `reported_at IS NULL`) — a duplicate Slack post, never a lost one.
This is an AT-LEAST-ONCE contract, not exactly-once, by design: the failure
mode this script must never have is a verdict that silently vanishes because
the process died between "sent" and "recorded." An occasional duplicate
message in a thread is a cosmetic annoyance; a lost verdict is the thing
Phase 3 exists to prevent.

WAKE-UP NUDGE. The verdict above is posted via `hermes send`, i.e. as
Hermes's own Slack bot user — and Slack ingest unconditionally drops
Hermes's own messages (echo-loop protection), so nothing wakes the agent
when an episode finishes. For an *actionable* dispatch (done, implement
tier, has an artifact URL, not already merged — see is_actionable()), this
script additionally posts a short nudge through argo's Slack API, which
posts as the HomeLab bot — a different user Hermes does ingest — strictly
AFTER `reported_at` is stamped, and best-effort (its failure never affects
`reported_at` and never raises — see send_nudge()). The nudge body is
restricted to fields the dispatch bridge itself owns (job id, repo, tier,
artifact URL) and never carries episode-authored text — see
build_nudge_body()'s docstring for why that boundary is a security
property, not a style choice.

LOST JOBS. sideclaw prunes a job ~24 h after it finishes. A dispatch whose
verdict was never folded in before that (sideclaw restarted mid-run, the
sweeper was down for a day, the job id was never real) answers 404 forever,
and "retry next sweep" forever is a debt that can never be paid. So a 404 —
and ONLY a 404, never a connection failure — increments `poll_misses` on the
row; the third consecutive one marks the row terminal `lost`, delivers a
one-line notice into the origin thread (or the undeliverable sentinel), and
stamps `reported_at` so it is never polled again. A successful poll resets
the counter, so three misses spread across a flapping sideclaw do not count.
