"""Alert triage — the act-loop that turns deduplicated watchdog.db events into
one durable, updated-in-place Slack card per problem, with a real sideclaw
investigation attached once a signature repeats or stays open. THE ACT PATH
(ingest -> classify -> cluster -> escalate -> card -> resolve) MAKES NO LLM
CALL AT ALL (the dispatched sideclaw `investigate` episode itself runs Claude
Code, which is inherent to what "investigate" means — that is a property of
hermes-cc.sh, not of this script). The ONE exception in the whole file is
`propose_mappings()` — a bounded, once-a-day maintenance pass, batched, never
in the act path itself — see PROPOSE MAPPINGS below.

Runs every 10 min as a Hermes `no_agent` cron script (via triage-cron.py, the
thin loader — see that file's docstring for why it has to stay thin).

WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/watchdog-poll.py` already ingests `#alerts` and the
other sources into `events` (deduplicated by `normalize_title()`/UNIQUE(source,
external_id)), but nothing ever ACTED on that dedup — Hermes instead ran a full
`reasoning_effort: high` LLM turn on every inbound alert MESSAGE, discarding
most of the replies via a NO_REPLY marker. Because `slack.reply_in_thread: true`
makes every alert its own session, that turn had zero memory of the last time
the exact same signature fired: the same `research-gateway job.reaped >= 1
(15m)` alert was triaged 61 times in one day, reaching the same conclusion each
time, without ever noticing a fix already existed. See config.yaml's `slack:`
comment block and docs/triage.md for the full before/after.

THE LOOP, once per run — see docs/triage.md for the full state machine:
  1. Ingest      — upsert one triage_items row per open ingest-source event,
                   including op_refs_homelab/op_refs_vps (a dead 1Password
                   ref blocks every future secrets-cache reseal — this must
                   reach at least the digest, never silently drop).
  2. Reopen/unsnooze — undo a stale `resolved`/`snoozed` state the underlying
                   event has since moved past (grouped sources reuse the same
                   events.id across a resolve -> recur cycle, so this is a
                   state fix-up, never a new row).
  3. Classify     — fnmatch MULTIPLE targets per event (see MATCH TARGETS
                   below) against config/triage-policy.json, in order: the
                   explicit `ignore` list (genuine recoveries/known-benign —
                   route to `ignored`, terminal, invisible), the structural
                   `ignoreUnstructuredSlackProse` fallback (route to
                   STATE_NOTE — terminal, but VISIBLE in the digest, see that
                   state's own docstring for why), then `rules` (resolve
                   EITHER `repo`, escalate to an episode, OR `verb`, run a
                   declared local command — see VERB OUTCOMES below). Only
                   ever touches a row still in state `new`.
  4. Resolve      — an event whose events.resolved_at is now set flips its
                   triage_items row to `resolved`.
  4b. Quiet/paired resolve — the two GROUPED_TRIAGE_SOURCES (slack_alert,
                   hermes_log) never disappearance-resolve via step 4 at all
                   (watchdog-poll.py's own sweep_stale_grouped only clears
                   them after 7 idle days). resolve_recovery_paired() checks
                   a fresh #alerts fetch for a `✅`-prefixed message pairing
                   the same alert text (see that function's own docstring);
                   resolve_quiet_grouped() falls back to a quietResolveHours
                   silence timer. Neither ever claims "fixed" — see
                   QUIET_RESOLVE_NOTE_PREFIX/RECOVERY_PAIRED_NOTE_PREFIX.
  5. Dissolve     — a cluster (see CLUSTERING below) whose folded verdict says
                   its members do not share a root cause splits back into
                   individually-eligible `new` items.
  6. Escalate     — every `new`+`repo`-mapped+eligible item, GROUPED BY REPO,
                   becomes at most one sideclaw `investigate` dispatch per
                   repo per run (a cluster), not one per item.
  6b. Verbs       — every `new`+`verb`-mapped+eligible item runs its
                   allowlisted local command once (see VERB OUTCOMES) — never
                   an episode, never clustered with repo-mapped items.
  7. Card         — one Slack card per cluster (or per verb outcome), posted
                   once state leaves `new` (an unescalated item, mapped or
                   not, is carried silently — see CARDED STATES below) and
                   updated in place after, no-op when the rendered content
                   hasn't changed.
  8. Propose      — at most once per 24h (see PROPOSE MAPPINGS below), one
                   batched LLM call over signatures that have stayed `new`
                   with no `repo`/`verb` for longer than
                   `proposeMappingsAgeDays`, proposing `map`/`ignore`/`unsure`
                   per signature. Applied outcomes land ONLY in
                   config/triage-policy.json (never triage_items directly),
                   committed (never pushed) in this repo's own checkout.
  9. Once a day, one digest message with up to three sections: signatures
     that matched no policy rule, STATE_NOTE rows (see step 3), and whatever
     step 8 just auto-added this run.

PROPOSE MAPPINGS — the one LLM call in this file. `config/triage-policy.json`
was designed to grow only by a human reading the daily unmapped digest and
hand-editing the file — measurably not happening: a signature that fired, got
hand-fixed once, then reappeared four months later matched nothing, because
the fix was never turned into a rule. `propose_mappings()` closes that loop
as cheaply as this problem allows: at most once per 24h (a cursor in
`cursors`, the same table the digest already uses), batched into ONE request
against the Hermes brain over the same OpenAI-compatible endpoint
config.yaml already configures (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`/`OPENAI_API_KEY`, model
`gpt-5.6-luna`), secrets resolved the same way every other secret in this
file is — never a plaintext key. At most `PROPOSE_MAPPINGS_MAX_SIGNATURES`
candidates per run: every `new` item with no `repo`/`verb` whose event has
been open longer than `proposeMappingsAgeDays` (policy knob, default 7 — a
signature younger than that may still be a one-off, and mapping it wastes a
whole investigate episode). The model returns strict JSON, one of three
shapes per signature: `ignore` (append to the ignore list — safe and cheap to
get wrong), `map` (append a rule — a wrong mapping costs at most one wasted
read-only `investigate` episode, bounded and visible), or `unsure` (leave
unmapped, and record the attempt so it is not re-billed on every run for
`PROPOSE_UNSURE_COOLDOWN_DAYS`). A `map` proposal's repo is re-validated
against the SAME discovery hermes-cc.sh's own `resolve_repo()` uses (must
resolve under `root`, must not be `deny`d) — never trusted from the model's
own claim alone, see BOUNDS THAT DO NOT MOVE. Every applied entry is stamped
`proposedAt`/`proposedBy: "triage-auto"` plus the model's one-line reason,
written back into config/triage-policy.json (preserving `_readme` and key
order), then `git add` + `git commit` — never `git push` — that ONE file, in
this repo's own checkout. Skipped outright, loudly, if that path already
carries a pending change, rather than sweeping an unrelated edit into an
auto-authored commit. A failed, timed-out, or unparseable model call is
logged to stderr and otherwise a no-op — this loop must never depend on it
succeeding, exactly like every other externally-visible call in this file.

`scripts/dispatch-sweep.py` closes the other half: when a dispatch tied to a
triage cluster (dispatches.origin_event_id) reaches a terminal status, it
calls `fold_dispatch_verdict()` below to fold the verdict onto every member's
row and the shared card — without waiting for this script's own next
10-minute pass.

MATCH TARGETS. `_match_targets()` builds TWO strings per event:
`f"{source}:{external_id}"` and `f"{source}:{normalize_title(title)}"`
(imported from watchdog-poll.py). A policy rule is tried against both, first
match wins. This matters most for state sources (`uk`) whose external_id is
an opaque UptimeKuma monitor id ("204") — unglobbable and unstable across a
monitor recreate — so `uk:macmini-dev-host-push` (the title-derived target) is
what makes that source mappable at all. For grouped sources (`slack_alert`,
`hermes_log`) the two targets are usually identical (their external_id already
IS normalize_title(title) — see aggregate_slack_batch()/poll_hermes_logs() in
watchdog-poll.py), so the second target is a harmless no-op there.

CLUSTERING. Multiple signatures can share one root cause — the shipped
example: `research-gateway job.reaped` and `audio-gateway podcast.failed` were
both `threshold: 0` in the same commit, fixed by the same two-line diff in the
same repo. `escalate()` groups every eligible `new` item BY RESOLVED REPO and
opens at most ONE sideclaw dispatch per repo per run (capped at 5 signatures
per brief; the rest wait for the next run), rather than one dispatch per item.
Cluster membership is DERIVED, never stored as its own column: every CARDED
triage_items row sharing a non-NULL `dispatch_job` value IS one cluster — a
dedicated `cluster_id` column would just duplicate that fact under a different
name. `_dissolve_cluster()` resets a split cluster's members to state `new`
(which drops them out of every cluster grouping — see CARDED STATES below),
but deliberately leaves `dispatch_job` itself set on those rows purely as a
cooldown anchor, not a live cluster pointer — see that function's own
docstring for why clearing it outright would let the escalate() call in the
very same run instantly re-fuse the pair it just split. The clustering is a
HYPOTHESIS from deterministic co-occurrence, never an assertion: the brief
tells the episode so explicitly and asks it to confirm or split it (see
DISSOLVE_MARKER below).

THE TWO EDGES THIS FIXES. `events.dispatch_id` (Phase 3 projection, added by
watchdog-poll.py, never written) and `dispatches.origin_event_id` (accepted by
hermes-cc.sh's `--origin-event`, never passed) were both always NULL before
this file existed. `--origin-event` takes exactly one events.id (one
dispatches row = one episode), so `escalate_cluster()` passes the cluster's
PRIMARY member there — hermes-cc.sh's own INSERT writes origin_event_id from
it, no second writer races `dispatches` for that column — and then does the
`UPDATE events SET dispatch_id=?` for EVERY member itself, which is the one
edge nothing else can write.

CARDED STATES. A card exists only once an item has left `new` — an item that
is mapped but hasn't yet crossed minOccurrences/minOpenMinutes, or is simply
unmapped, is carried silently (visible only in the once-a-day daily digest —
see maybe_post_daily_digest()). This is what keeps an empty or partial policy
from turning into dozens of cards of noise on day one. STATE_NOTE is
deliberately excluded too — see that state's own docstring.

VERB OUTCOMES. A policy rule can name `verb` instead of `repo` — routes to a
declared, code-side ALLOWLISTED local command instead of a sideclaw episode.
The rule names a KEY (e.g. `"env-check"`), never a command — a policy file
must never be able to name an arbitrary argv, the same closed-verb-set
principle hermes-cc.sh's own dispatch/status/list/merge/cancel verbs use.
Seeded with exactly one: `env-check` (hermes-ops.sh's ssh-based 1Password
ref-health probe), which op_refs_homelab/op_refs_vps route to. Cheaper than a
dispatch AND safer: a bare 1Password item name in the output doesn't match
sideclaw's `op://vault/item/field` secret-scan pattern the way a dispatched
verdict would, so the useful answer survives onto the card instead of being
withheld. Terminal state is `needs_human`; run_verbs() runs the command at
most once per item (see that function's own docstring for why no cooldown
tracking is needed) and the card's note IS the whole verdict — the dangling
item name plus the exact remediation, so no further investigation is needed.

DRY-RUN CONTRACT. `--dry-run` never touches Slack (no chat.postMessage/
chat.update) and never shells out to hermes-cc.sh — those two are the only
externally-visible actions this script can take. Every other step (ingest,
reopen/unsnooze, classify, resolve, dissolve bookkeeping) is local
bookkeeping against triage_items alone, idempotent and side-effect-free, so
it runs for real even under --dry-run: that is what lets a dry run against a
throwaway copy of watchdog.db print a meaningful "what would be carded and
dispatched" preview instead of nothing at all.

# policy file must never be able to name an arbitrary argv (or, here, an
# arbitrary probe). Unlike VERB_ALLOWLIST these four run IN-PROCESS rather

# reads, and the fourth (kuma-push-last) needs both a secret
# (HOMELAB_API_KEY, which must never cross an argv/`ps` boundary) and
# per-cluster context (which UptimeKuma monitor actually fired) that a fixed

    that is fully DOWN also stops emitting, so silence alone can never tell
    the two apart, but an explicit recovery message can.

    This is cheap specifically because HyperDX's own webhook posts the
    IDENTICAL alert text with only the leading glyph flipped (see the brief
    that shipped this: "the titles differ only by the leading glyph"), and
    normalize_title() already strips every non-alnum character — including
    both glyphs — so a `✅ research-gateway job.reaped >= 1 (15m)` message
    normalizes to the SAME string as `🚨 research-gateway job.reaped >= 1
    (15m)`. For a grouped source that string already IS the event's own
    stable `external_id` (see docs/triage.md's MATCH TARGETS — computed once
    at first-batch time and never re-derived), so no new text-matching
    scheme is needed: one fresh #alerts fetch, one dict lookup per
    candidate.

    This CANNOT be read back out of `events`/`payload_json` — upsert_grouped()
    only retains one title (whichever batch's group needed to emit) and never
    a per-occurrence history (see docs/triage.md's own note on that), so a ✅
    that lands in the same 30-min batch as its 🚨 counterpart is silently
    folded into a bumped `batch_count` with no trace of which glyph it was.
    Reading live #alerts instead of `events` is what makes this possible at
    all — and it stays cheap because it is ONE fetch per triage run
